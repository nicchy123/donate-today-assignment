       <h3>Shelter For a Family</h3>
       <p class="gray">Families told us that they need more space and protection from the elements. They also told us they would use shelter
      kits and tarpaulins to avoid crowding in host families’ homes by creating more living and cooking space.Hundreds of people were driven out of their homes or shelters as the third wave of flooding swept Bangladesh with the
      total number of flood victims crossing 3 million on Wednesday.</p>

        <h3>They need us to survive</h3>
        <p>Poor people are disproportionally affected by natural hazards and disasters. This paper provides a review of the
        multiple factors that explain why this is the case. It explores the role of exposure (often, but not always, poor people
        are more likely to be affected by hazards), vulnerability (when they are affected, poor people tend to lose a larger
        fraction of their wealth), and socio-economic resilience (poor people have a lower ability to cope with and recover from
        disaster impacts).</p>
